Hello, everybody.

This website is devoted to serve as a follow-up mean for my for the End on Master's Degree (spanish TFM).

Currently, I'm focused on an expansion of the TFG work I delivered two years ago, so we are still actively working on that GitHub repository, [have a look!](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2017-tfg-nacho_condes)

Please notice that, as it is under active development, it might be unstable when trying to use it. So, we created beforehand [a release encompassing the last stable version](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2017-tfg-nacho_condes/releases/tag/TFG). You can work on it without functional issues!

Feel free to reach me on [email](mailto:nachocmstrato@gmail.com) for any further concerns.
